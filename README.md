# 🛡️ Anomaly Detection in Machine Learning

This repository contains implementations of various **Anomaly Detection** techniques in Machine Learning.  
The goal is to create a **comprehensive, well-documented collection** of methods for detecting unusual patterns in data — which can be applied in fraud detection, network security, healthcare, manufacturing, and more.

---

## 📌 Current Progress
- **Isolation Forest** — An ensemble-based method that isolates anomalies instead of profiling normal data.

---

## 📚 Planned Methods
Below are some popular Machine Learning techniques for anomaly detection that will be implemented in this repository:

### **Statistical & Distance-Based**
- Z-Score & Modified Z-Score
- Interquartile Range (IQR) Method
- Mahalanobis Distance
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)-based outlier detection

### **Clustering-Based**
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- k-Means anomaly detection
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for anomaly scoring

### **Tree-Based**
- Isolation Forest ✅ (implemented)
- Extended Isolation Forest

### **Dimensionality Reduction-Based**
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reconstruction error
- Autoencoders (basic feedforward autoencoder)

### **Ensemble & Hybrid**
- One-Class SVM
- Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- Robust Random Cut Forest (RRCF)
